A small statcc web application project created for exercise purpose. To enhance and familiarize with front-end web development, web design with HTML, CSS and Javaccript or JQuery.  
## References

This project is built referenced to a tutorial from Traversy Media on YouTube. The foundation layout of the website built is similar to the referenced video but the color, font size, etc as well as the decoration of images are self personalized and customized. This project is mainly for me to get myself exposed to responsive website building and gain experiences in front end designing.

For the YouTube video tutorial referenced for this project, check out the [Traversy Media Tutorial on Responsive Website Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4) here.\
